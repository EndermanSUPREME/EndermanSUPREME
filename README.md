<summary>What do I do?</summary>
<pre>
I like keeping myself busy.

  I have more about me over at https://endermansupreme.github.io/endernet/.
  In summary I enjoy programming and I enjoy Capture the Flags, I do challenges
  between PicoCTF and HackTheBox, personally I prefer HackTheBox, but Pico is not bad.

  I like to dabble in multiple areas, I started out in Video Game Design in Unity
  then slowly started to pivot into general programming and ethical hacking exploitation.
